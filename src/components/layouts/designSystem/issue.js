        <p>Saagie is a Bid data software editor who first started business in dispensing hosting services and data managing tools.
          At a certain point in their growth, the company realized that their customers needed a proper infrastructure to manage
          their data projects in a more concrete and simple way.
          In response to their demands, Saagie launched in 2015,
          their platform called Saagie. The product team needed a solution to unify and move the existing tools onto this unique product.
        </p>
        <p> The design team, of which I was a member, was asked to find a scalable design solution that could be quick and easy to implement for the Development team.
          We opted for a React Design System Library.
